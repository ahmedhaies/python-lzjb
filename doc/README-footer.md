Original Code
-------------
This was ported to Python based on:
- [The original C code](http://web.archive.org/web/20100807223517/http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/fs/zfs/lzjb.c)
- [The JavaScript port](https://code.google.com/p/jslzjb/source/browse/trunk/Iuppiter.js), which adds the inclusion of the uncompressed data size as a prefix

Thanks of course to these authors for contributing their code as open source.
